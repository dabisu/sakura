Installing sakura
===============

* How to compile and install this beast ?

	$ ./0 
	$ make
	$ su -c 'make install'

	sakura use the MOBS building system. That means you need to run the "0"
	script instead of a "configure" script, but the syntax is very similar.

	In this example, the 0 script is executed without any parameters, so sakura
	gets installed in the default directory (/usr/local), but you can
	tell to 0 your favourite installation directories, in an syntax very 
	similar to 'configure'. For example, to change the prefix installation
	directory and the data directory, run 0 with the command './0 --prefix=/usr'
	For all the installation options run './0 --help'.


Keybindings support
===================

sakura support keyboard bindings. They're not yet configurable
(unless you hack the source ;)), but they'll be.

Ctrl + Shift + 't'		-> New tab
Ctrl + Shift + 'w'  	-> Close current tab
Ctrl + '+'				-> Increase font size
Ctrl + '-'				-> Decrease font size
Alt  + 'Left cursor'	-> Previous tab
Alt  + 'Right cursor'	-> Next tab

Enjoy sakura !
